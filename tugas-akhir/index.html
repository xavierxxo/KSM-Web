                <p>Andrew John Hozier-Byrne (born 17 March 1990), known 
                    professionally as Hozier (/ˈhoʊziər/ HOH-zee-ər), is an 
                    Irish musician, singer and songwriter. His music 
                    primarily draws from folk, soul and blues, often using 
                    religious and literary themes and taking political or 
                    social justice stances.
                </p>
                <p>He began writing songs at the age of 15, taught himself 
                    guitar and sang in his school choir. He was educated at 
                    Delgany National School. His parents were raised Catholics 
                    but converted to Quakers. Despite this, he later attended the 
                    Catholic St. Gerard's School before studying music education 
                    at Trinity College Dublin. He missed exams to record demos for a 
                    music label and was refused a year's deferral by the college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His debut single, "Take Me to Church" (2013), became a 
                    rock radio hit in the U.S., peaked at number two on the 
                    Billboard Hot 100, and has been certified multi-platinum 
                    in several countries. His eponymous debut studio album (2014) 
                    has been certified 6× platinum in Ireland and multi-platinum 
                    in several other countries. His EP Nina Cried Power (2018), 
                    which featured the title track as a single, reached number 
                    one on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart. His 
                    second album, Wasteland, Baby! (2019), debuted atop the Irish 
                    Albums Chart and the Billboard 200, and was certified gold 
                    in the U.S. His third studio album, Unreal Unearth (2023), 
                    was released on Rubyworks Records, and debuted at number one on the 
                    Irish and UK charts. In 2024, he released the EP Unheard, which 
                    includes the song "Too Sweet".

                        <h3>Hozier (2014)</h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        Hozier is the debut studio album by Irish musician Hozier. 
                        It was released on 19 September 2014 by Island Records and 
                        Rubyworks Records. Before the album's release, he attracted 
                        attention from his 2013 and 2014 EPs Take Me to Church (2013) 
                        and From Eden (2014), which contained songs that were later 
                        included on the album. Hozier collaborated with producer Rob 
                        Kirwan during its recording. Hozier has been described as a 
                        blues, soul and indie rock album with elements of gospel, R&B 
                        and folk music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hozier received positive reviews from music critics, many of 
                        whom praised Hozier's songwriting and vocal performance. The 
                        record was also commercially successful, reaching top ten positions 
                        in several countries, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United 
                        States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark and 
                        Sweden. Five of the album's singles—"Take Me to Church", "From Eden", 
                        "Sedated", "Work Song", and "Someone New"—charted in the top-50 of the 
                        Irish Singles Chart. The album's lead single, "Take Me to Church", was 
                        a huge success worldwide and also earned a nomination for Song of the 
                        Year at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in 2015. Following the release of 
                        the record, "Jackie and Wilson" and "Cherry Wine" were released as the 
                        album's sixth and seventh singles, respectively.

                        <h3>Unreal Unheard (2023)</h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        Unreal Unearth is the third studio album by Irish musician Hozier, released 
                        on 18 August 2023. It contains the singles "Eat Your Young" and "Francesca", 
                        along with the song "All Things End". Hozier toured Ireland, the UK, North 
                        America, Australia, and New Zealand in support of the record from June 2023 
                        to November 2024. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, 
                        and debuted at number one on the Irish and UK charts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unreal Unearth is inspired by Dante's Inferno and the concept of the nine circles 
                        of Hell alongside many mythological and biblical references. Hozier also draws from 
                        characters and logic seen in Flann O'Brien's novel The Third Policeman. Unreal 
                        Unearth as a whole signifies a journey through Dante's nine circles of Hell and coming 
                        out at the other side, with each song(s) referring to a specific “universal theme” or 
                        feeling. Hozier reveals the meaning and inspiration behind the lyrics in a Behind the 
                        Song series on his YouTube Channel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unreal Unearth received a score of 76 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based 
                        on 14 critics' reviews, indicating "generally favorable" reception.
